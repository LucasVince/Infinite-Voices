# üîê Security & Performance

## 1. Overview  
Security is a fundamental priority at Infinite Voices. We ensure the protection of user data, system integrity, and resilience against common attacks, while maintaining a smooth and reliable user experience.

## 2. Data Security

### Authentication and Authorization  
- Use of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to authenticate users.  
- Tokens are validated on every protected request to ensure authorized access.  
- Implementation of token blacklist for revoked tokens (logout).

### Secure Storage  
- Passwords are stored using bcrypt with salt for protection against brute-force attacks.  
- Sensitive data is never exposed on the frontend or in logs.

## 3. Protection Against Common Attacks

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- Strict sanitization of user inputs before rendering.  
- Use of Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit execution of untrusted scripts.

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)  
- Implementation of CSRF tokens to protect critical endpoints.  
- Verification of request origin to validate integrity.

### Code Injection and SQL Injection  
- Use of ORM/ODM (MongoDB + Mongoose) to avoid injection in queries.  
- Validation and sanitization of all inputs.

### Rate Limiting and IP Blocking  
- Limiting requests per IP to prevent brute-force and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

## 4. Communication Security

### HTTPS Enforcement  
- All communication between client and server occurs over HTTPS to protect against interception.

### Cookie Security  
- Session cookies are configured with HttpOnly and Secure flags to prevent script access and ensure secure transmission.

## 5. Monitoring and Logging  
- Logging of suspicious events for early attack detection.  
- Continuous performance monitoring to identify potential vulnerabilities and failures.

## 6. Performance with Security  
- Implementation of secure caching to speed up responses without compromising sensitive data.  
- Compression and optimization of responses to improve user experience.

## 7. Recommendations for Developers  
- Always validate and sanitize all user inputs.  
- Keep dependencies up to date to avoid known vulnerabilities.  
- Periodically review code for potential security flaws.
